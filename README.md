# Abandonded Project Warning
The code in this repository is now non-functional due to a change in the VRCMG API and I don't really plan on continuing the project, I recommend using something like MelonAssistant which serves as the same type of application but is actively being worked on. Feel free to use any code from this in your Projects however.

## Introduction
This project provides an all in one application to install/uninstall VRChat mods using VRChat Modding Group's (VRCMG) API. This project also serves as an alternative to PogManager.

## Usage
- Download the installer linked in the Releases tab on Github and install the application on your computer.
- Open the application and click on the 'Available Mods' tab at the top
- Install all the mods you would like to use (*Note: Some mods may be incompatible with other mods or not be up-to-date!*)
- Launch VRChat (Either via the mod manager, or through Steam directly)
- Enjoy!

## Contributions
This project is entirely open source and if you would like to submit a pull request feel free! I am always open to critique and constructive criticisms so don't hesitate!
