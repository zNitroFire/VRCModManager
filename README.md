## Introduction
This project provides an all in one application to install/uninstall VRChat mods using VRChat Modding Group's (VRCMG) API. This project also serves as an alternative to PogManager.

## Usage
- Download the installer linked in the Releases tab on Github and install the application on your computer.
- Open the application and click on the 'Available Mods' tab at the top
- Install all the mods you would like to use (*Note: Some mods may be incompatible with other mods or not be up-to-date!*)
- Launch VRChat (Either via the mod manager, or through Steam directly)
- Enjoy!
